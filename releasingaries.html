<h1 id="how_to_do_an_aries_release">How to do an Aries Release</h1>
<p>To create a release you will need to create the release artifacts and move
then to various places (ultimately the Maven central repository). The Maven
commands and general outline of the process looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="rel" src="AriesRelease.png" /></p>
<p>The picture assumes that you are releasing from a branch rather than from
trunk. The full maven commands are not shown - the intention is just to
give an indication of which maven commands you will need to use to create
assets in different places.</p>
<p>Performing a release is described in detail <a href="-http://apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html.html">here </a>
. This document It covers all the steps listed above so on these pages we
will only add things which are specific to the Apache Aries release. Note:
the document has not been release and this link will need to be updated
when it has.</p>
<p>There are a few steps to the process:
1. Discussion of the release and its content on the aries-dev mailing list.
1. Creating and storing GPG keys
1. Setting up your environment
1. Creating a branch to release from
1. Checking release artifacts on your local system
1. Creating a snapshot release (optional - not really part of the release
process, uses mvn deploy)
1. Releasing to a staging repository (uses mvn release:prepare and mvn
release:perform)
1. Running a vote
1. Promoting the release artifacts to the Apache release repository
1. Making the release artifacts available from the Aries web pages
1. What to do when people find problems with the release artifacts</p>
<p>The best current documentation for releases is <a href="-http://apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html.html">here </a>
 - but this isn't released yet. It covers all the steps listed above so on
these pages we will only add things which are specific to the Apache Aries
release.</p>
<p><a name="ReleasingAries-Discussionofthereleaseandit'scontentontheAriesmailinglist"></a></p>
<h3 id="discussion_of_the_release_and_its_content_on_the_aries_mailing_list">Discussion of the release and its content on the Aries mailing list</h3>
<p>Before starting off the release process it is essential to gain concensus
on the aries-dev list that this is the right time for a release and to
agree its content. Allow at least a week for this discussion. </p>
<p><a name="ReleasingAries-CreatingandstoringGPGkeys"></a></p>
<h3 id="creating_and_storing_gpg_keys">Creating and storing GPG keys</h3>
<p>For Aries your GPG key will need to be in this file:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/aries/KEYS (follow the
instructions in the file) and checkin</p>

<h3 id="creating_a_branch_to_release_from">Creating a branch to release from</h3>
<p>Although this isn't strictly speaking a necessary step it's pretty useful
to do it. Running the commands to create the release can take some time,
especially if you have to revert anything. This is much easier if you are
working in your own branch and not in trunk where other people may be
committing code.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>Where '0.X' is the number of the release.</p>
<p>Checkout the new branch, for example, for the 0.2-incubating  release:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">co</span>
<span class="n">https:</span><span class="sr">//s</span><span class="n">vn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="sr">/repos/</span><span class="n">asf</span><span class="sr">/incubator/</span><span class="n">aries</span><span class="sr">/branches/</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">incubating</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">RCx</span>
<span class="n">aries</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">rc2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">candidate</span>
</pre></div>


<p><em>IMPORTANT</em> If you are using a branch to release you <em>must</em> edit the top
level pom.xml for each module to change the SCM references to point to the
branch and to to trunk. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;connection&gt;</span>scm:svn:http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/aries/branches/0.2-incubating-RCx/parent<span class="nt">&lt;/connection&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;developerConnection&gt;</span>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/aries/branches/0.2-incubating-RCx/parent<span class="nt">&lt;/developerConnection&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;url&gt;</span>scm:svn:http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/aries/branches/0.2-incubating-RCx/parent<span class="nt">&lt;/url&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The consequence of forgetting this is that the commands that create the
release (mvn release:prepare, mvn release:perform) will declare SUCCESS but
will not create a staging repository and will add stuff to the snapshot
repository :-/.</p>
<p>After taking the branch, change the pom versions in trunk to, say,
0.3-incubating or whatever you want to call the next development version.</p>
<p><a name="ReleasingAries-Checkingreleaseartifacts"></a></p>
<h3 id="checking_release_artifacts">Checking release artifacts</h3>
<p>I recommend deleting everything under ...org/apache/aries in your local
Maven repo. For linux/Mac users you will find this under ~/.m2/repository/.</p>
<p>Check that the code builds using the usual <a href="-buildingaries.html">sequence </a>
 of commands, but add the following arguments to the 'mvn install' command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DcreateChecksum</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">true</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This should build and install release artifacts in your local repo. </p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/aries/parent/0.1-incubating/">0.1 release</a>
 to understand what files should be created.</p>
<p>To perform legal checks, in each subproject, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">rat:check</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">fn</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will run through the project and its sub projects generating a file
called rat.txt in each target directory.
The 'fn' means it will carry on even if it find a failure. To inspect the
failures, the easiest way I've found so far is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">find</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">rat</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">txt</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">xargs</span> <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="o">\!\</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="p">?</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will pick out the failing file names. Some of the files that rat fails
do not require an Apache license, eg MANIFEST.MF, but any <em>.java or </em>.js
file does need one.</p>
<p><a name="ReleasingAries-Creatingasnapshotrelease"></a></p>
<h3 id="creating_a_snapshot_release">Creating a snapshot release</h3>
<p>TBD. This isn't a necessary step in the release process but should still be
documented here.</p>

<h5 id="creating_the_release_artifacts_in_a_staging_repository">Creating the release artifacts in a staging repository</h5>
<p>Aries is released as a set of modules, not all the modules in Aries are
part of the release. Some modules depend on other modules. The release is
created by releasing each module separately and in a specific order. It is
also desirable to maintain the same IP address for the entire process (the
staging repository is associated with your IP address, changing it results
in the creation of a second staging repository).</p>
<p>Short summary: Use a wired ether net connection and allow about 4 hours for
the next few steps.</p>
<p>From the top level directory in your branch run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then, change directory to 'parent'. It is necessary to release parent first
because everything else depends on it. Run the following commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">release:prepare</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">release:perform</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span>
</pre></div>


<p><em>Note</em> The prepare step will make some assumptions about the version of the
development steam that is left after the release has been made. When
releasing from a branch it may not be a good idea to accept the default for
this, it will very likely conflict with the development version in use in
trunk.</p>
<p>The install command is required to make sure that you have a copy of the
parent in your local repository - it's required for releasing the
eba-maven-plugin.</p>
<p>This _should _ start to put release artifacts into an Apache <a href="https://repository.apache.org/index.html#view-repositories;staging.html">staging repository </a>. You will need to log in to see it.
If nothing appears in a staging repo you should stop here and work out why
:-). If you have made a mistake it's quite easy to revert. The release
commands make and commit changes to the project's pom.xml files and they
create a tag in SVN. To revert the changes you will need to revert the
pom.xml files and delete the tag from svn.</p>
<p>If you are in Europe the mvn release:prepare command almost always fails at
the last step, with a message like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ERROR</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="p">)</span>

 <span class="o">------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">INFO</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">svn:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">such</span> <span class="n">revision</span> <span class="mi">936951</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is due to the SVN mirroring in place between Europe and the master in
the US. When you make a commit, it isn't immediately available in Europe to
svn up to. Just wait 10 secs and repeat the mvn release:prepare command for
it to restart where it left off.</p>
<p>The next step is to release the eba-maven-plugin.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span><span class="sr">/eba/m</span><span class="n">aven</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">plugin</span>

<ul>
<li>Note 1: when doing mvn versions:* actions in samples, you must also
manually change the version properties that are hard coded in the top level
pom.xml. The only '-SNAPSHOT' you should have left in samples/pom.xml is
the version element for the module itself.</li>
<li>Note 2: -DpreparationGoals="clean install"  is needed for all modules
that have sub modules with dependencies between them, in practice this is
most modules.</li>

<h5 id="closing_the_staging_repository">Closing the staging repository</h5>
<p>After checking that the staging repository contains the artifacts that you

so that people can check the release.</p>

<h3 id="running_the_votes">Running the vote(s)</h3>
<p>Two votes are required for an incubator release. The first from the
aries-dev@incubator.apache.org list, the second from
general@incubator.apache.org. These run consecutively, 72 hours is required
for each vote.</p>
<p>After all the modules are present in the staging repository you will need
to close the repository so that reviewers can access the modules. At this
point you should write two notes to the aries-dev mailing list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject [VOTE](vote.html)
 Apache Aries (Incubating) version 0.X-incubating release candidate 02</li>
</ul>
<p>The the source archive files should be explicitly called out by release
manager in any release vote. From an Apache legal standpoint, this is what
the project is "releasing" and what the community should be voting on. In
this <a href="-http://people.apache.org/~zoe/devlistvote.txt.html">sample note</a>
, there is a link to each modules' source*.zip file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject [DISCUSS](discuss.html)
 Apache Aries (Incubating) version 0.X-incubating release candidate 0X</li>
</ul>
<p>The content should just indicate that the note starts a thread to discuss
the Aries 0.X-incubating release.</p>
<p>After 72 hours, if no problems have been found in the release artifacts,
the aries-dev vote can be summarised and closed. Note that at least three
+1 votes from Aries IPMC members are required. </p>
<p>After closing the vote on the aries-dev list, the second vote (on the
general@) can be started. Here is a <a href="http://people.apache.org/~zoe/generallistvote.txt">sample note</a>
, the subject of the note is [VOTE]Approval to release Apache Aries
(Incubating) version 0.X-incubating</p>
<p>After another 72 hours, assuming there are no objections, this vote can
also be summarised and closed.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories">Nexus pages</a>
, select the staging repository and select 'release' from the top menu.
This moves the release artifacts into an Apache releases repository, from
there they will be automatically moved to the Maven repository.</p>

<p>Anything that is to be downloaded must be put in
/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/aries on minotaur. The distributions are
archived here /www/archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/aries.</p>
<p>First, delete the previous distribution from the distribution directory.
Download the release artifacts using a script like <a href="-http://people.apache.org/~zoe/release-0.2-.html">this</a>
. Next, update the Aries Downloads pages to refer to the new artifacts.</p>

<p>The release process makes changes to project poms and adds a tag in svn.
The first step is to revert the changes to the poms in the problem modules.
The following steps work on a *ix like platform:</p>
<p>Determine which revision you want to go back to (eg XXXXX)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">up</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="n">XXXXXX</span>
<span class="n">find</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">pom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xml</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">xargs</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="p">{}</span> <span class="n">mv</span> <span class="p">{}</span> <span class="p">{}</span><span class="n">_old</span>
<span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">up</span>
<span class="n">find</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">pom</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xml</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">xargs</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="p">{}</span> <span class="n">mv</span> <span class="p">{}</span><span class="n">_old</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="c1">#Check what you have changed!</span>
<span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="s">&quot;reverting release changes&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next - delete the tag relating to the module from SVN</p>
<p>Finally - delete the folder from the staging repository (this seems to take
several attempts and a very long time to achieve)</p>
<p>Make the fixes that you need to in the project, commit them and work
through the release process again. </p>
<p>In some cases you may also want to merge from trunk into the release
branch. The syntax to do this is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">merge</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">ZZZZZZ</span> <span class="n">https:</span><span class="sr">//s</span><span class="n">vn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="sr">/repos/</span><span class="n">asf</span><span class="sr">/incubator/</span><span class="n">aries</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">trunk</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Where ZZZZZZ is the revision associated with the fix.
Note that you will be creating a new staging repository. The commands are
repeated here for convenience:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">versions:update</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">parent</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">versions:use</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">releases</span>
<span class="n">svn</span> <span class="n">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;version&gt; RC&lt;#&gt;: updated to latest releases&quot;</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">release:prepare</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DpreparationGoals</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;clean install&quot;</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">release:perform</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Papache</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">release</span>
</pre></div></div>
